# Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm for Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
This project implements the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm for Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) in C++. The CYK algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to determine whether a given string belongs to the language generated by a CFG. It works efficiently for CFGs in Chomsky normal form.

## Features
+ Implements the CYK algorithm to check if a given word belongs to the language generated by a CFG.
+ Reads the CFG configuration from an input file.
+ Supports CFGs in Chomsky normal form.
+ Demonstrates word derivations by decomposing them into non-terminals.

## Files
+ **CFG.h** - Header file defining the **CFG class**.
+ **CFG.cpp** - Implementation of the **CFG class methods**.
+ **main.cpp** - Main program that sets up the CFG, reads the configuration, and tests word acceptance.
+ **date.in** - Input file containing the CFG configuration.


## CFG Configuration File (date.in)
The configuration file follows this format:

+ Number of non-terminals.
+ List of non-terminals.
+ Number of production rules.
+ List of production rules in the format: left_symbol right_symbol.
+ Start symbol.
+ Number of words to test.
+ List of words to test.
